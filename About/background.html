<h1> <a name="Background"> Background </a> </h1>

<p>
    Since 2012 I have been answering questions occurring at the cross-roads of hydraulic and environmental engineering. A large portion of this work has been devoted to improving fish passage through engineered hydraulic structures (i.e. roadway culverts and dams). 
</p>

<p>
    Both computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and experimental fluid methods have played important roles in my research. In particular, the open-sourced CFD model OpenFOAM, due to its strengths and immense flexibility, has proven a valuable tool in these projects. On the experimental front, stereoscopic particle image velocimetry, which provides three component vectors over a 2-D plane, has allowed me to ‘visualize’ flow fields to levels of spatial and temporal detail that would otherwise have been impossible using other experimental flow measurement techniques.      
</p>   

<p>
    Aside from my work in fish passage, I also have an interest in all things related to fluid mechanics, hydrotechnical work and fluvial systems. Recently, I compared a two-phase Euler-Euler computational fluid dynamics model to a comprehensive laboratory data set with the goal of assessing the model’s ability to model bubble driven recirculatory flow in a municipal waste-water treatment plant. I was also involved in validation work of the Vectrino Profiler performed at the Université de Sherbrooke. Soon, I will be embarking on a project using OpenFOAM to model suspended sediment transport loads through a municipal sediment trap near the mouth of river located in Southern Québec. Have a look at my Research projects page for in-depth looks at some of my work.
</p>

<p>
    My plan is to continue pursuing projects, either in academia or in industry, with a strong emphasis on hydrotechnics, ecological hydraulics and applied research. If you have a project idea or opportunity which you believe may benefit from my experience, don’t hesitate to get in contact, I would be happy to discuss.
