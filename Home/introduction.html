<h1> <a name="Introduction"> Introduction </a> </h1>


<p> I began putting this page together to serve as a central online location to exhibit my research, my professional interests and blog on various topics related to CFD (OpenFOAM, pyFVM), experimental fluid mechanics, ecohydraulics and the use of various research tools. Feel free to have a look at the Research projects page or contact me to ask a question or inquire about possible collaboration opportunities. </p>
